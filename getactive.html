        <h2>Ways to Combat (and Embrace) Boredom</h2>
        <h3>Eight ways to harness the positive power of boredom.</h3>
        <p>While your first instinct may be to peruse the remainder of your Netflix queue, passive activities like watching television do not boast the boredom-busting benefits you may think they do. 
          <br>
        Psychological research has shown that while television inspires an opiate response in the body, its effects are relatively short-lived, leaving you feeling even more bored and unhappy than before you grabbed the remote control. Instead, pick up a hobby that will teach you something for the long haul -- cooking, playing an instrument or even practicing yoga. The satisfaction of learning a new life skill lasts far longer than the fleeting happiness associated with a reality TV binge.

        <h3>Schedule time for daydreaming</h3>
        <p>Become proactive.
        Start by listing out all of the things you need to accomplish the night before. If you can, avoid checking email before lunch. Turn your phone on silent. This way, you’ll get a head start on things that are actually important for you to get done. You’ll suddenly realize that you do in fact have time for 5-10 minutes of sitting idly.
        Change your mindset. 
        It’s very hard to imagine that actually doing nothing can be just as productive as spending an extra hour at work. We’ve been conditioned to think that working harder equals more results. That’s simply not true.
        If you have a limited amount of time, start a timer. Then, just let your mind wander...sitting idly and daydreaming is a perfect accompaniment to your busy day for a healthier and more creative brain.
