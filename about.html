    <h2>Site Intro</h2>
      <p>This site was created to help people live more productive fulfilling lives, despite the omnipresence of technology. There's no doubt that we have use for technology in our lives. The challenge we face is using technology responsibly and in moderation- not to impede our growth, development, and <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/philanthropy">philantropic</a> relationship with others.
        <br>
        <br>
         My mission is to <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/thesaurus/rectify">rectify</a>
        this irrational, monotonous,
        senseless, <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/acquiescent">acquiescent</a>, and <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/incorrigible ">incorrigible</a> set of fundamental beliefs we have towards technology and its role in our lives.
        <br><br>
        Unfortunately, some of us have forgotten what it's like to live independently from technology, and have become extremely reliant upon it.
        <br><br>
        This co-dependency has created an epidemic, which has led the average citizen to experience constant emotional imbalances, shortening the average attention span, and creating <br> an anti-socialistc, isolating culture amongst the interaction of our peers. 
        <br><br> 
        By providing resources, awareness, and implementing various forms of <a href="https://www.simplypsychology.org/operant-conditioning.html">operant conditioning</a> and <a href="https://www.simplypsychology.org/classical-conditioning.html">classical conditioning</a>, I believe that we can coexist with technology and also live a healthier lifestyle.</p>
