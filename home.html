    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>Tech Maverick is a site built to help people develop technological <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/interdependence">interdependence</a>. 
      In today's day-in-age we are virtually tethered to our devices, as we are captivated by its presence. 
    <br>
    <br>
      My vision was to create an all-inclusive toolkit so that anyone may live a more fulfilling life if they choose so.
      Technology and mankind should always be a <a href ="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/symbiosis">symbiotic</a> realtionship. So that, as a society, each and every one of us has the opportunity to reach his/her full potential. <br>

    Let's move forward and leave a lasting impact on society, fulfilling our purpose. </p>

        It's rather splendid outside,
        <br>
        <br>
        better than waiting to turn gangrene from grieving, I guess.
        <br>
        <br>
        Over a rock I sit, contemptuous.  
        <br>
        <br>
        He is my transportation.
        <br>
        <br> 
        He is my rest and nutrition,
        <br>
        <br>
        On which I rely my head upon.
        <br>
        <br>
        My anxiety when I'm with you is filtered through your colander of life;
        <br>
        <br>
        Dispelling what is cumbersome, 
        <br>
        <br>
        Leaving us rich in prosperity,   
        <br>
        <br>
        So that we may become credulous to abide within His supremacy.
        <br>
        <br> 
        Gilt is no longer permeable to our souls. I say,
        <br>
        <br>
        Like a driver to a golf ball, 
        <br>
        <br>
        I soar with the wind;
        <br>
        <br>
        Further away from the ground's deception, 
        <br>
        <br>
        And anger within. 
        <br>
        <br>
        He is omnipresent even though I only soar temporarily;
        <br>
        <br>
        I am no longer in sin.
        <br>
        <br>
        A lucky charm to all clovers,
        <br>
        <br>
        Sprouting what He protracted; 
        <br>
        <br>
        Always reminiscent of the light we see.
        <br>
        <br>
