    <h1>The Era of Convenience</h1>
    <h2>Convenience is key in the digital age</h2>
    <img class="image" src="images/raconteurArticle.jpg" alt="This is an abstract portrait of a person being surrounded by the apps on their phone">
      <p>"In the age of the smartphone, convenience has taken on a whole new meaning.
      But while connected devices have undoubtedly made tasks like ordering milk more convenient, they’ve also made the process much more complicated.

      For brands, it’s easy to see why this is a scary prospect. How can you build a relationship with consumers when they no longer have to visit your store – or even your website – and they are being presented with a bigger range of retailers, products, services and service providers than ever before?"

    <p>"In just a few short years, wearable technology has gone from being nonexistent to being everywhere. Because of this sudden spike in popularity, wearables have the potential to change our lives and society, for better or worse. Because they're so new, it's difficult to tell what effects they will have, but we can speculate based on our current knowledge of them."
    It's important to consider how this information becomes big data to be collected and used by companies and governments. This means, whether you like it or not, that your tracked information could be used for marketing or health purposes. There are positive ways this information could be used, but as with all big data there's also a chance it could be misused.
